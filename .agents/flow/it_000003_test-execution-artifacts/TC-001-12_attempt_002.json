  "prompt": "# Execute Test Batch\n\nExecute all provided automated test cases from the approved test plan in a single session.\n\nAll generated content must be in English.\n\n## Inputs\n\nUse the provided context sections:\n- `project_context`: project conventions, runtime, quality checks, and constraints\n- `test_cases`: JSON array of test case objects, each with id, description, mode, and correlated requirements\n\n## Execution Rules\n\n1. Read all test cases in `test_cases` before running any commands.\n2. Follow constraints from `project_context` when selecting commands, environment setup, and verification steps.\n3. Execute each test case in order. Share session context (e.g. environment setup, installed dependencies) across test cases to avoid redundant work.\n4. Capture concise evidence from command outputs or observed results for each test case.\n5. Determine outcome per test case:\n   - `passed`: acceptance for this test case was satisfied\n   - `failed`: acceptance for this test case was not satisfied\n   - `skipped`: test case cannot be executed due to a justified blocker\n\n## Output Contract (Mandatory)\n\nOutput MUST be raw JSON only. No markdown fences, no introductory text, no trailing instructions. Do not output markdown or additional text outside the JSON array.\n\nReturn only a JSON array with one result object per test case, in the same order as the input. Each object must have this exact shape:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"testCaseId\": \"the test case id\",\n    \"status\": \"passed|failed|skipped\",\n    \"evidence\": \"string\",\n    \"notes\": \"string\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nEvery test case in the input must have a corresponding result in the output array.\n\nCorrect: output the array directly (or inside a single ```json block if necessary). Incorrect: adding text like \"Here are the results:\" or \"Run this command:\" before or after the JSON.\n\n\n---\n\n## Context\n\n### project_context\n\n# Project Context\n\n<!-- Created or updated by `bun nvst create project-context`. Cap: 250 lines. -->\n\n## Conventions\n- Naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions, kebab-case for files\n- Formatting: Prettier + ESLint defaults\n- Git flow: feature branches per iteration (`feature/it_XXXXXX`), merged to main after approval\n- Workflow: Define → Prototype → Refactor per iteration; adhere to this file from iteration 2 onward\n\n## Tech Stack\n- Language: TypeScript\n- Runtime: Browser (client-side only, no backend)\n- Frameworks: React 19 + Vite, React Three Fiber (R3F)\n- Key libraries: Strudel REPL (in-browser audio via Web Audio API)\n- Package manager: bun\n- Build / tooling: Vite\n\n## Code Standards\n- Style patterns: functional components, hooks for state and side effects\n- Error handling: user-visible error messages for audio failures (autoplay policy, Web Audio support, REPL errors)\n- Module organisation: `src/components/` for UI, `src/lib/` for pure logic (pattern generation, parameter mapping)\n- Forbidden patterns: no backend calls, no custom audio pipeline (use Strudel REPL natively)\n\n## Testing Strategy\n- Approach: TDD — write tests before implementation\n- Runner: Vitest\n- Coverage targets: none enforced for MVP\n- Test location convention: co-located `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` next to source files\n\n## Product Architecture\n- Single-page browser app; no server required\n- User configures parameters (mood, tempo, style) → clicks Generate → client-side logic maps params to a Strudel pattern string → Strudel REPL executes pattern in-browser via Web Audio API\n- R3F used for visual/animation layer alongside audio playback\n\n## Modular Structure\n- `src/components/`: UI components (parameter controls, player, error/loading states)\n- `src/lib/pattern-generator.ts`: pure function mapping UI params → Strudel pattern string\n- `src/lib/strudel.ts`: Strudel REPL integration (init, play, pause, error handling)\n\n## Implemented Capabilities\n<!-- Updated at the end of each iteration by bun nvst create project-context -->\n- Lofi theme\n- Parameter controls\n- Audio generation\n- Playback controls\n- Error handling\n\n\n### test_cases\n\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-001-12\",\n    \"description\": \"Backend code passes typecheck / lint\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-002-06\",\n    \"description\": \"Frontend code passes typecheck / lint\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-003-05\",\n    \"description\": \"Backend code passes typecheck / lint\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"TC-FR-10\",\n    \"description\": \"Backend has `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` with expected dependencies\",\n    \"mode\": \"automated\",\n    \"correlatedRequirements\": [\n      \"FR-10\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n",
